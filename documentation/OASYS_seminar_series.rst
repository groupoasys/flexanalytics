OASYS Seminar Series
====================

As a vital forum for brainstorming, collaboration and sharing results, the *OASYS Seminar Series* was born.  A monthly seminar/research platform where, not only members of OASYS working on the *FlexAnalytics* project, but also international researchers in the field, present their ideas, and get a fresh take on the ongoing work of *FlexAnalytics*.
A number of new working relationships across Europe have been forged, thanks to this initiative.
