Abstract
--------
The optimal power flow (OPF) is one of the fundamental mathematical tools currently used for the operation of power systems. Under certain assumptions, the power flow equations can be linearized using the power transfer distribution factors (PTDF), leading to the so-called DC-OPF. Initially formulated as a deterministic problem, the DC-OPF problem has been reformulated to take into account that some of the input parameters are uncertain. In this article, we present different DC-OPF formulations to determine the optimal power dispatch of generating units under an uncertain electricity demand. We formulate the problem using robust programming, stochastic programming, and chance-constrained programming.
