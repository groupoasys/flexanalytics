Abstract
--------

The prospective participation of smart buildings in the electricity system is strongly related to the increasing active role of demand-side resources in the electrical grid. In addition, the growing penetration of smart meters and recent advances on home automation technologies will spur the development of new mathematical tools to help optimize the local resources of these buildings. Within this context, this paper first provides a comprehensive model to determine the electrical consumption of a single-zone household based on economic model predictive control. The goal of this problem is to minimize the electricity consumption cost while accounting for the heating dynamics of the building, smart home appliances, and comfort constraints. This paper then identifies and analyzes the key parameters responsible for the price-responsive behaviour of smart households
