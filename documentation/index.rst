Welcome to Flexanalytics project webpage!
==========================================
Flexanalytics is a ERC Starting Grant project developed by `OASYS group`_.

This project aims to provide data-driven methodologies to paradigmatic problems in power systems operations in the context of smart grids.

Preamble
--------
 Activating the demand response, although a major challenge, may also bring tremendous benefits to society, with potential cost savings in the billions of euros. This project will exploit methods of inverse problems, multi-level programming and machine learning to develop a pioneering system that enables the active participation of a group of price-responsive consumers of electricity in the wholesale electricity markets. Through this, they will be able to make the most out of their flexible consumption. 
 
 `Flexanalytics` proposes a generalized scheme for so-called inverse optimization that materializes into a novel data-driven approach to the market bidding problem that, unlike existing approaches, combines the tasks of forecasting, model formulation and estimation, and decision-making in an original unified theoretical framework. The project will also address big-data challenges, as the proposed system will leverage weather, market, and demand information to capture the many factors that may affect the price-response of a pool of flexible consumers.
 
 On a fundamental level, `Flexanalytics` will produce a novel mathematical framework for data-driven decision making. On a practical level, `FlexAnalytics` will show that this framework can facilitate the best use of a large amount and a wide variety of data to efficiently operate the sustainable energy systems of the future.
