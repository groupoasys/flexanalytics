Welcome to Flexanalytics project webpage!
==========================================
`FlexAnalytics`  is an ERC Starting Grant project led by `Juan Miguel Morales`_, and developed by his research group `OASYS`_. This project has received funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (grant agreement No 755705).

This project aims to provide data-driven methodologies for paradigmatic problems in power systems operations in the context of smart grids.

Preamble
--------
 Activating the demand response, although a major challenge, may also bring tremendous benefits to society, with potential cost savings in the billions of euros. This project will exploit methods of inverse problems, multi-level programming and machine learning to develop a pioneering system that enables the active participation of a group of price-responsive consumers of electricity in the wholesale electricity markets. Through this, they will be able to make the most out of their flexible consumption. 
 
 `FlexAnalytics` proposes a generalized scheme for so-called inverse optimization that materializes into a novel data-driven approach to the market bidding problem that, unlike existing approaches, combines the tasks of forecasting, model formulation and estimation, and decision-making in an original unified theoretical framework. The project will also address big-data challenges, as the proposed system will leverage weather, market, and demand information to capture the many factors that can affect the price-response of a pool of flexible consumers.
 
 On a fundamental level, `FlexAnalytics` will produce a novel mathematical framework for data-driven decision making. On a practical level, `FlexAnalytics` will show that this framework can facilitate the best use of a large amount and a wide variety of data to efficiently operate the sustainable energy systems of the future. 

On this site you can find more details on `FlexAnalytics`. All work related to the project is summarised below.
