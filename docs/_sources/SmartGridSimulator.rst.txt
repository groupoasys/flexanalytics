.. sectionauthor:: Ricardo Fern√°ndez-Blanco <Ricardo.FCarramolino@uma.es>

One of the main goals of `Flexanalytics` is to build a smart grid simulator (as shown in :numref:`figsimulator`) for distribution grids including the following features:

* A real-life data portfolio
* A battery of test cases for the distribution system of the future
* A plethora of data-driven power system operations for the distribution grid
